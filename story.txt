There once was a boy named Quinn. He had a really bad nut allergy, but he didn't want to tell any of his friends. He went to get dinner with them and enjoyed their company, but when it came time for dessert, he noticed there was a pecan pie lying in his wake. "Would you like some pie?" One of them asked. But Quinn just stood there and pretended he was full.
